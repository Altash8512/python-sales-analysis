# Sales Data Analysis & Visualization

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a sales dataset. The primary goal is to uncover trends, identify key performance indicators, and derive actionable insights to inform business strategy. The analysis is performed using Python, and the results are visualized through various charts and an optional interactive dashboard.

## Project Objective

To analyze sales data to understand performance across different dimensions such as time, product, category, and region. The final output includes data-driven insights and recommendations for business growth.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `sales_data.csv`, which contains transactional sales records. If you are using your own dataset, please ensure it is in a CSV format and place it in the root directory.

**Columns:**
- `Order_ID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Date`: Date of the transaction.
- `Category`: Product category.
- `Product`: Name of the product.
- `Region`: The sales region.
- `Units_Sold`: Number of units sold in the transaction.
- `Unit_Price`: Price of a single unit.
- `Revenue`: Total revenue from the transaction (`Units_Sold` * `Unit_Price`).
- `Cost`: Total cost of the goods sold.
- `Profit`: Profit from the transaction (`Revenue` - `Cost`).

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For static data visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive data visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For creating and sharing the analysis.
- **Streamlit**: (Optional) For building an interactive web dashboard.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd sales-analysis-project
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyterlab streamlit
    ```

3.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
    Then, open `sales_analysis.ipynb` to view and run the analysis.

## Key Analysis and Visualizations

- **Time Series Analysis**: Monthly and quarterly trends for revenue and profit.
- **Product & Category Analysis**: Bar charts showing revenue and profit by product category and top-performing products.
- **Regional Analysis**: A pie chart illustrating the revenue contribution of each sales region.
- **Correlation Analysis**: A heatmap showing the relationships between numerical variables like `Units_Sold`, `Revenue`, and `Profit`.

## Key Insights

1.  **Sales Trends**: Sales show seasonality, with peaks likely corresponding to holiday periods.
2.  **Top Categories**: The `Electronics` category is the most profitable and generates the highest revenue.
3.  **Top Products**: `Laptop` and `Smartphone` are the leading products in terms of both revenue and profit.
4.  **Regional Performance**: The `East` and `West` regions are the top contributors to revenue.

## Actionable Recommendations

1.  **Targeted Marketing**: Focus marketing efforts on top products in high-performing regions.
2.  **Inventory Management**: Adjust stock levels based on seasonal demand to prevent stockouts or overstocking.
3.  **Product Strategy**: Promote and invest further in the `Electronics` category. Consider bundling less popular items with best-sellers.
4.  **Regional Growth**: Investigate underperforming regions to identify growth opportunities.

## How to Run the Streamlit Dashboard

To view the interactive dashboard, run the following command in your terminal from the project's root directory:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

This will open a new tab in your web browser with the interactive dashboard.
